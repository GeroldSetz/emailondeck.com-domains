# emailondeck.com-Domains
This repository is being generated based on the data of www.block-disposable-email.com. Updates committed on a daily basis as long as additions appear.

## What you get
The data you can download at https://github.com/GeroldSetz/emailondeck.com-domains/blob/master/emailondeck.com_domains_from_bdea.cc.txt is a list of alternative domains used by emailondeck.com. 

## Intention
The intention of this file is to let you check your userbase or new subscribers against this managed blacklist to detect fake subscribers. As mentioned the data comes from our main project www.block-disposable-email.com, which already serves thousands of clients.

What we provide here is a specific subset of our comprehensive blacklist which contains domains only that are hosted by emailondeck.com. In case the community finds the data useful we'll publish domains of other main-providers the same way. However, we encourage you to use our api to get access to more than 10.000 dea domains from hundreds of different temporary email services.

## Upgrades
If you are looking for more up-to-data dea domains please take our api into consideration or use one of the existing modules for standard software (such as Wordpress, phpBB, Java, ...) . It includes hundreds of alternative domains of well-known temporary email provider such as Yopmail, discard.email, mytemp.email, 10minutemail, generator.email as well as widely unrecognised services. 

Feedback, suggestions, ... appreciated.

PS: This is similar to our mailinator.com list (see https://github.com/GeroldSetz/Mailinator-Domains).
